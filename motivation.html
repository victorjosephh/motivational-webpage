    <h2>The Story of Thomas Edison — One Step at a Time</h2>
        <p>Thomas Edison is known today as the inventor of the light bulb, but his journey was far from easy. Before success, he faced thousands of failed experiments. Many people believed he was wasting his time, and some even said he should give up.

He didn’t have everything figured out. Each attempt brought new problems instead of clear answers. But instead of seeing failure as the end, he treated each setback as a lesson. He moved forward slowly, testing one idea after another...one step at a time.

There were moments when progress felt impossible, and the path seemed endless. Yet he understood that hard moments don’t last forever if you keep learning and adapting. He didn’t rush or compare his pace to others; he focused on steady progress.

After thousands of attempts, he finally created a working light bulb. When asked about his failures, he said he had not failed, he had simply found many ways that did not work.

His journey reminds us that success rarely comes from perfect plans. It comes from persistence, patience, and continuing forward even when the outcome is uncertain.</p>
